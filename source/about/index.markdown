My name is Brandon Weaver, and I work as an Infrastructure Automation and DevOps Engineer at Sony Network Entertainment Int'l in San Francisco.

In off hours I'm a Musician, an [Artist](http://www.baweaver.deviantart.com), a [Comicker](http://www.srccomic.com), a Writer, an Athlete, and whatever in the world happens to have caught my interest this week. I'm an avid polymath aiming to try a bit of everything in life.

## What do I do?

Ruby, Rails, Javascript, AngularJS, NodeJS, and a tinge of Elixir on the side.

## What experience do I have?

I have LinkedIn for that one: [Brandon Weaver on LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/pub/brandon-weaver/36/781/a96/)

## Why do you do?

Hacking about is my passion. I've always got multiple project ideas that I want to give a shot, and a notebook full of them. I love to create, to build, to make things that help people.

## Contact

Ping me on Twitter [@keystonelemur](http://www.twitter.com/keystonelemur) or shoot me an email at brandon_weaver@baweaver.com 

I'm currently very happily employed, and do not wish to speak with recruiters at this time.
