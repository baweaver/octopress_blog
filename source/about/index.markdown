My name is Brandon Weaver, and I work as a Software Engineer at Cerner
in Kansas City.

## What do I do?

Ruby, Rails, and the usual Web Stack.

## What experience do I have?

I started as a DevOps at a Wireless ISP, automating hundreds of wireless
antennas with home made Ruby utilities and frameworks for about two
years. I did everything from design to climbing up a water tower to
deploy equipment. My nickname very quickly became the Technical
Macgyver.

I'm a Unix guy, I live in a command shell. Vim and ZSH are my weapons of
choice, and I have a tendancy to automate anything that takes more than
five keystrokes at a time.

## Why do you do?

Hacking about is my passion. I've always got multiple project ideas that
I want to give a shot, and a notebook full of them. I love to create, to
build, to make things that help people.

I'm currently very happily employed, and do not wish to speak with
recruiters at this time.
