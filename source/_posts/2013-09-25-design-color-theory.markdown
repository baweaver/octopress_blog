Before you even start to worry about how your site looks you need to
know color. How it works, what each one means, what they create when
placed in relation, the works.

## Color: What does it mean?

Each color leaves a distinct impression, so naturally it is within our
best interest when designing a page to take this into consideration. 

**Red**: Red is a color that is often used to symbolize passion, love,
anger, and overall strong emotional response. It is best used on sites
that have to do with intense emotional issues, such as dating.

**Orange**: Orange is a color that represents adrenaline, action, thrills.
Being a combination of the intense emotion of red and the happy-go-lucky
yellow it brings with it a plethora of reactions. It is best used on
sites that have to do with thrills such as amusement parks and racing.

**Yellow**: Yellow embodies happiness and joy, but be careful because it can
also very easily be seen as cowardly. Yellow is a color that cannot
stand on its own, remember that it needs something else to stand on,
black being a common choice. It is best used in groups, but can be used
to accent other colors.

**Green**: Green is growth and wealth. It is related to trees and money,
making it an ideal choice for businesses, banks, and groups.

**Blue**: Blue is a very professional color. It is calm and collected and is
right to business. It does not incite heavy emotional reactions, but
promotes a sense of calm and collectiveness that makes it perfect for
business and professional usage.

**Purple**: Purple is a very noble color, almost suffocating at time. Unlike
yellow it is a very bold color that needs to be used in moderation,
otherwise it will quickly overwhelm other elements on a page. Purple is
great in moderation and in conjunction with blue.

**Black**: Black is all over the map, it means anything from evil to
collected professionalism. I prefer to refer to it as a neutral color
that doesn’t harbor emotion to it. It has a certain elegance about it.

**White**: White is a color of innocence and purity. It is considered the
clean color, but as with black it is neutral, adding no real emotion to
the page.

Don’t believe me? Go to Google Image Search and select a color on the
side, see what types of images most often pop up for each type of color.

## Groupings

Colors are best used in groups of no more than 2 to 3 different colors,
not including neutral colors like black and white.

The best inspiration for color sets is from photography. Get out a
camera and take a photo of what you believe embodies the site you’re
trying to make. Use that photo and pick out 3 to 5 colors from it,
remember to keep a balance of light and dark colors in your choice. This
is your swatch.

There are various resources online that are of substantial help in
finding good color combinations, among which stock photos can be the
most useful.

Sites like Adobe Kuler are nice in the short run but leave you
completely reliant on someone else’s work to accomplish your task.
You’ll only be able to truly capture the feeling of your site with
images that speak to you, whether they are yours or stock.

## Complimentary and Oversaturated Colors

As much as people will swear to the effect of complimentary colors, they
are best avoided in excess. Small amounts of these colors will give you
an edge to your site, but done in excess will blind your user. Orange
and Blue done right is one of the most commonly used, check out half of
the modern movie posters (like batman.)

The same is true of oversaturated colors used in excess. Remember to use
neutral colors liberally and go easy on strong colors like red and
purple. It is very easy to overwhelm a visitor, be careful of using too
much.

## Conclusion

Different colors can mean a world of different things, and selecting the
right colors can make a substantial difference in your site. The number
one thing to remember in design is to use things very sparingly, the
point is to accent your content, not a flying circus of a page made in
the depths of geocities.
