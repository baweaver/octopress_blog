As I'm transferring platforms, I've imported several old tutorials. You
may notice that some of my tutorials are no longer listed and are only
availible on the old site. The reasoning is that I intend to update
those tutorials and do them more justice.

<!-- more -->

Does that mean that I've done nothing with the other articles? No, I've
patched them up to detail HTML5 and some newer concepts, but they will
inevitably need to be redone evantually as well.

I do concede that I've posted this site with the default template still
intact, something I intend to correct later, but for now it would be
preferable to get a site up and running first.

Here's to Octopress and getting back into Blogging!
